## Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Approach
The siteâ€™s design prioritizes mobile usability, ensuring an intuitive experience on small screens that scales up nicely for larger devices.

### Database Operations
To efficiently handle batch inserts, I switched from the pg library to Postgres.js, overcoming limitations with inserting multiple rows in a single query.

### UI
For a consistent and appealing UI, I predominantly used my own and modified components provided by Shadcn.

### Planned Changes
- **Payment Integration**: Add methods for purchasing premium brushes.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement advanced search to help users find specific brushes.
- **Editing Capabilities**: Allow users to modify their existing listings.
